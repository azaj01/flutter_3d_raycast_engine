# Flutter 3D Raycasting Engine

This project implements a 3D raycasting engine in Flutter, allowing you to simulate a 3D environment using 2D graphics and basic raycasting techniques. The engine renders a first-person perspective view similar to classic games like Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features

- **Raycasting Rendering:** Simulates 3D graphics using 2D projections and raycasting.
- **Player Movement:** Move the player using W, A, S, D keys.
- **Map Editing:** Includes a map editor to create custom maps interactively.
- **Mini Map:** Toggleable minimap for navigation.
- **Texture Rendering:** Toggle to enable/disable texture rendering on walls.
